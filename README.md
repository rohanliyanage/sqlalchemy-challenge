Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with your trip planning, 
you decide to do a climate analysis about the area. The following sections outline the steps that you need to take to accomplish this task.

Part 1. Climate Analysis and Exploration
a) Precipitation Analysis
b) Station Analysis

Part 2. Climate App
Now that you have completed your initial analysis, design a Flask API based on the queries that you have just developed.
Use Flask to create routes. 
List all routes that are available.

/api/v1.0/precipitation
/api/v1.0/stations
/api/v1.0/tobs and /api/v1.0/start_date
